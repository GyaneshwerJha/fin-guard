1. ** `app.use(morgan("dev"));` **
   - This line integrates the  `morgan`  middleware into the Express application. 
   -  `morgan`  is a logging library that generates logs for incoming HTTP requests. The  `"dev"`  argument specifies the logging format, which is concise and includes information such as the HTTP method, URL, response time, and status code. This helps developers monitor and debug their applications by providing real-time request logs in the console.

2. ** `app.use(cors());` **
   - This line adds the  `cors`  middleware to the application.
   -  `cors`  stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, which is a mechanism that allows restricted resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the first resource was served. By including this middleware, the application allows requests from different origins, which is essential for APIs that are accessed by client-side applications hosted on different domains.

3. ** `app.use(express.json());` **
   - This line incorporates the built-in  `express.json()`  middleware.
   - It parses incoming requests with JSON payloads and makes the parsed data available in  `req.body` . This is particularly useful for handling requests where the client sends data in JSON format, such as in RESTful API calls. Without this middleware, the application would not be able to automatically parse JSON data from the request body.

Overall, these middleware functions enhance the functionality of the Express application by providing logging, enabling cross-origin requests, and facilitating JSON data handling.
